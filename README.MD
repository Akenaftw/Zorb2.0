In this excercise we learned how to deal with the situation of someone developing the html and css side
while the other person focusses on JS. What made this extra challenging was the fact that you
didn't get instant visual feedback on some parts of the excercise because you need JS to actually show pictures/open new tabs.

1) groundlayer Html, CSS
2) HTML code for the caroussel implemented
